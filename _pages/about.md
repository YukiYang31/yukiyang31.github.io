Hi, I am glad to find you here! I am Yuki Yang, an incoming PhD student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I will be advised by Professor [Mike Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/). 

I completed my undergrad at Harvey Mudd College, majoring in Joint Computer Science and Math, with Economics as my concentration. I was part of [Prof Lucas Bang](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~bang/index.html)'s ALPACA lab working on acympotic path complexity (APC). Feel free to ask me anything about APC!  

In my free time, I enjoy badminton, rock climbing, crochet, and photograpy!
